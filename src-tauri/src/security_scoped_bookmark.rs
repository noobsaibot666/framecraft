// Mac App Store build only. Framecraft's "portable" library mode requires
// the user to explicitly pick a `.framecraftlib` folder via a native panel
// (Tauri's dialog plugin) rather than scanning arbitrary paths, which is
// exactly the case macOS security-scoped bookmarks exist for: the sandbox
// grants access to a just-picked folder for the running process, and a
// bookmark is the supported way to regain that same access on a later
// launch — including after an SMB/NAS share remounts at a different
// underlying path — without a fresh folder-picker prompt every time.
//
// Not compiled for the direct-dist build at all: it's unsandboxed and has
// unrestricted filesystem access already, so there's nothing here for it
// to do. (objc2-foundation is still present in that build's dependency
// graph — see the comment on it in Cargo.toml — just unused.)
